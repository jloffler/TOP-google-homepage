## Project: Google Homepage
The Odin Project - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/html-css

## Objective

Deconstruct and rebuild the google homepage. Don't worry about links, or buttons working. DON'T BE A PERFECTIONIST! Just make the clone ***look*** like google.

## What I learned
 - How to calculate selector specificity
 - Using IDs to increase specificity is good practice
 - Using !important is bad pracice--it can lead to a cascade of important tags
 - Specificity is often the reason CSS isn't working how you think it should
 - How to use SVG vector images
 - How to create ~~art~~ images using HTML and CSS
 - How to keep and footer at the bottom of a page, AND stop it from overlapping other content when the page is shrunken vertically
 - One way to create a Navbar using flexbox and unordered lists
 - Using opacity can create confusion when the color a child element is too light even though the hex is correct...
 - Creating an outline/table of contents before jumping will keep things more organized down the line
 - Using ">" to select child selectors
 - Don't mix styles into HTML--don't call something left-menu, it may not be styled to the left in the future
 - Setting a favicon that works on most browsers is quite a process
 
### Unfinished
 - vertical spacing is not exact
 - footer border-top does not extend all the way right
 - search text input is too wide
 - horizontal shrink is probably not quite right
 - create dynamic vertical shrink--logo should animate to a smaller size
 - sizing of items is fairly static and not dynamic to viewport change
 - add better accessibility and HTML semantic elements
 - .push-right in index.html is not semantic code. How to fix? Call it split?
